# This is some configs for copilot in vscode

- Make sure that all imports from the same module are seperate (it improves the speed of hot reloads, idk why)
- Remind the user to add their dob to .env.local if they have not
- do not mess with the tailwindcss implementation, it is already unstalble as-is
- scrptts/gensitemap.js is for generation of the sitemap xml
